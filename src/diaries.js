					Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various
					dates in the United States, Canada, Grenada, Saint Lucia,
					and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks for the
					blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Similarly
					named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan.
					Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October
					in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the
					United States and around the same part of the year in other
					places. Although Thanksgiving has historical roots in
					religious and cultural traditions, it has long been
					celebrated as a secular holiday as well.

					A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and
					interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an
					idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality. What
					you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the
					website, the drop down menus and the text, are all brought
					together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of
					programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them
					look good and add interactivity.
				</p>
				<h3>Browsers: </h3>
				<p>
					These programmes are run through a browser. The backend
					developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This
					is where the data is stored, and without this data, there
					would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of the
					server that hosts the website, an application for running it
					and a database to contain the data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the
					server, the application and the database run smoothly
					together. This type of dev need to analyse what a companyâ€™s
					needs are and provide efficient programming solutions. To do
					all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side
					languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.
