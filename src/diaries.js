				<p>
					Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various
					dates in the United States, Canada, Grenada, Saint Lucia,
					and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks for the
					blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Similarly
					named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan.
					Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October
					in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the
					United States and around the same part of the year in other
					places. Although Thanksgiving has historical roots in
					religious and cultural traditions, it has long been
					celebrated as a secular holiday as well.
